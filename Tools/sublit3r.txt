What is Sublist3r?

Sublist3r is a handy tool used to find subdomains of a website. Subdomains are smaller sections of a main website (e.g., blog.example.com is a subdomain of example.com). Finding subdomains is important in penetration testing and bug bounty hunting because they can reveal hidden or vulnerable parts of a website.

How does it work?

Sublist3r uses multiple sources like search engines (Google, Bing) and public databases to gather subdomains. Itâ€™s fast, efficient, and easy to use.


command: sublist3r -d example.com -o sublister_subs.txt
